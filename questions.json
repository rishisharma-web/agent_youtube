Throwing it backwards only reduces this velocity, it doesn't completely negate it.

While airborne, the apple appears to move backward relative to the car.  However, once it hits the road, our brain's frame of reference shifts to the ground, revealing the apple's remaining forward velocity, making it seem as if it's following the car."
